That's an excellent question! The reason we use `vla->pop()` instead of `vla.pop()` is due to how we've declared and used the `VariableLengthArray` object in our main function. Let me explain:



1. Pointer vs. Object:
   In the main function, we declared `vla` as a pointer to a `VariableLengthArray` object:
   ```cpp
   VariableLengthArray* vla = nullptr;
   ```
   This means `vla` is a pointer, not an actual object.

2. Arrow Operator (`->`) vs. Dot Operator (`.`):
   - The arrow operator `->` is used to access members of a class through a pointer.
   - The dot operator `.` is used to access members of a class through an object.

3. Why We Use a Pointer:
   We use a pointer in this case because:
   a) We want to dynamically create and destroy the `VariableLengthArray` object based on user input.
   b) We need to be able to recreate the object when the user issues the "m" command to make a new array.

4. If We Used an Object Instead:
   If we had declared `vla` as an object instead of a pointer, like this:
   ```cpp
   VariableLengthArray vla(10);  // Example initial capacity
   ```
   Then we would indeed use the dot notation: `vla.pop()`

5. Current Implementation:
   Because `vla` is a pointer, we use the arrow notation: `vla->pop()`
   This is equivalent to `(*vla).pop()`, which dereferences the pointer and then uses the dot operator.

In summary, we use `vla->pop()` because `vla` is a pointer to a `VariableLengthArray` object, not the object itself. This approach gives us more flexibility in managing the lifecycle of the object, allowing us to create and destroy it as needed based on user input.

If you prefer using the dot notation, you could modify the main function to work with an object directly, but you'd lose the ability to easily recreate the array with a different initial capacity during runtime. The pointer approach allows for this flexibility.

Does this explanation help clarify why we're using the arrow operator? Let me know if you have any further questions!
