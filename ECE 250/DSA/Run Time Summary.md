**Quicksort** - Worst case run time : O(n^2)

**Comparison** sorting best possible run time : O(n log n)

**Counting sort**: has O(n + k) run time
- n num of elements in input array
- k is the range of input values, specifically diff between max and min

**Radix Sort:** O(d x (n+b)) Time complexity
- d is # of digits in largest num
- n is num of elements
- b is the base (10 for dec)
